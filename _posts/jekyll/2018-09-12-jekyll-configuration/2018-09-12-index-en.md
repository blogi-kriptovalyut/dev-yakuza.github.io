## jekyll settings
jekyll is very flexible system and has many configuration options for making a website. 설정은``_config.yml``` We focus on the options we use in here.

## Variables
Before we talk about settings, we quickly talk about basic jekyll variables for understanding the configurations. If you want to know more detail, please see [jekyll homepage(variables)](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" :target="_blank"}

### Global variables
- site: this is about site informations. This variable includes informations set on ```_config.yml``` and basic informations provided by jekyll.
- page: this variable is about current page informations. This has informations written in ```yml``` format at the top of the page file.
- content: this is used on layout files in ```_layout``` folder. This contains contents written on the page.

### site variable
You can declare variables in ```_config.yml``` and use it with ```site.[variable name]```. Almost plugins use ```_config.yml``` to set the necessary variables.
We introduce about ```site``` global variables we mainly use.

- site.time: this is a time variable when jekyll command is executed. we use it for ```sitemap.xml``` modification time, and css version on ```header``` tag for disabling cache.
- site.pages: this variable includes all pages except pages in ```_posts``` folder. we use it for writing all static pages on ```sitemap.xml``` except post pages, and category pages on the bottom of the [Top]({{site.url}}){:target="_blank"} page.
- site.posts: this is all pages in ```_posts``` folder.
- site.url: this is a site URL. this is used by configuring real site url(```https://dev-yakuza.github.io```). If you test the jekyll site by executing ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` command, jekyll ignore this url and automatically set ```http://localhost:4000```. When you execute ```bundle exec jekyll build``` command for deploying the site, jekyll use this url.

### page variable
Here are ```page```'s global variables which are on the top of the page with ```yml``` format.

- page.title: this is a page title. we use it on ```<title>``` tag in ```<head>``` tag, title on the top of the post and display post list on [category page]({{site.url}}/{{page.categories}}/){:target="_blank"}.
- page.url: this is the page url. we use it for everywhere that required the link like ```sitemap.xml```.
- page.date: the date assigned to the post.
- page.categories: the category list that is belonged the post.

#### Default settings
- title: this is the title of the site. basically, this is used on ```<title>``` tag in ```<head>``` tag, but we don't use it because we use ```titie``` variable on ```page``` options.
- email: this is a option for setting email. We use it for sending email to us on [Contact]({{site.url}}/{{page.categories}}/disqus/){:target="_blank"}. If you want to know how to send email on jekyll, please ses [Send email]({{site.url}}/{{page.categories}}/send_mail/){:target="_blank"}.
- description: just like ```title```, this will be on the page ```head``` tag. However, we use page ```description``` instead of this option.
- url: this is a site URL. this is used by configuring real site url(```https://dev-yakuza.github.io```). If you test the jekyll site by executing ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` command, jekyll ignore this url and automatically set ```http://localhost:4000```. When you execute ```bundle exec jekyll build``` command for deploying the site, jekyll use this url.
