and we just wait for Google Adsense allow it. normally take one day, but we took 2~3 weeks. we think we registered it when the blog site release. so we didn't have many contents(pages). that is reason not to allow it maybe.

so if you are in same situation, try to make contents(pages).

if many users see our blog or click the advertisement on the blog, Google Adsense gives us the money like above screen. we can withdraw that if that is more than a certain amount(Â¥8,000). when we withdraw that, we will write the blog about how to withdraw it.
