## Outline
sometimes, we need to access virtual machine(Guest System) from external environment not local machine(Host System). at this time, if you use ```ngrok```, you can access simply.

below link is the virtual machine(Guest System) for Laravel by Ansible to test ```ngrok```.

- [Ansible&Laravel]({{site.url}}/{{page.categories}}/ansible-laravel/){:target="_blank"}

the instruction of ```ngrok``` we'll talk in there is for developing and testing.

- ngrok official site: [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"}

## Configure Ansible
the virtual machine(Gust System) in below link is

- [Ansible&Laravel]({{site.url}}/{{page.categories}}/ansible-laravel/){:target="_blank"}

like below.

```bash
|-- ansible
|    |-- init
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- docker
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- laradock
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- php
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|-- Vagrantfile
```

we need to add ```role``` for ```ngrok```, so create ansible/ngrok/taskas/main.yml file.

```bash
|-- ansible
|    |-- init
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- docker
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- laradock
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- php
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|    |-- ngrok
|    |    |-- tasks
|    |    |    |-- main.yml
|-- Vagrantfile
```

open ```ansible/ngrok/tasks/main.yml``` and modify it like below.

```yml
---
- name: Unarchive ngrok
  become: true
  unarchive:
    src: ngrok.zip
    dest: /vagrant
  tags:
    - ngrok
```

actually, this ```role``` just unarchives the file. let's download the file needed at here.

- ngrok download site: [https://ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"}

or you can download from our repository.

- laravel-devtool github: [laravel-devtool](https://github.com/dev-yakuza/laravel-devtool/blob/master/ansible/files/ngrok.zip){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"}

copy it to ```ansible/files```.

modify ```ansible/playbook.yml``` like below to use ```ngrok``` ```role```.

```
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  roles:
    - init
    - docker
    - laradock
    - php
    - ngrok
```

## Execute Virtual Machine
execute below command to start the virtual machine(Guest System).

```bash
vagrant up
```

if you execute this for the first time, it takes a long time. also, it executes automatically ```ngrok``` setting we added above.

if you've already executed the virtual machine with our Ansible configuration, you need to do belows.

```bash
# vagrant up
vagrant ssh
sudo ansible-playbook /vagrant/ansible/playbook.yml --tags 'ngrok'
```

## Execute ngrok
execute below command to start ```ngrok```.

```bash
# vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant/
./ngrok http 80
```

and then, you can see below screen.

```
Session Status                online
Session Expires               7 hours, 59 minutes
Version                       2.2.8
Region                        Asia Pacific (ap)
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://cf354047.ap.ngrok.io -> localhost:80
Forwarding                    https://cf354047.ap.ngrok.io -> localhost:80
```

you can access the virtual machine(Guest System) by ```Forwarding``` URL in here. this is only for testing and developing, use it when you develop or test the application.

## Completed
to develop api server for App, you can easily use api server on the virtual machine(Guest System) in the local machine(Host System) by ```ngrok```.

you can see our Laravel virtual machine(Guest System) by Ansible, at below link.
