## Outline
we try to use jwt(Json Web token) to make token based authentication system on Laravel. if we implement everything of jwt authentication system, it's hard and takes long time. so we decided to use [tymon/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"} middleware to develop jwt authentication system.

in this blog, we'll see how to install and configure ```tymon/jwt-auth```. if you want to more detail about ```tymon/jwt-auth```, see below links.

- tymon/jwt-auth: [https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth](https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"}
- tymon/jwt-auth document: [https://jwt-auth.readthedocs.io/en/develop/](https://jwt-auth.readthedocs.io/en/develop/){:rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"}

## Repository
we've made the repository of jwt authentication system. click below link to see our repository.

## Development Environment
in here, we'll use Laravel development environment created by Laradock and Ansible. if you want to know our environment, see our previous blog.

- [Ansible&Laravel]({{site.url}}/environment/ansible-laravel/){:target="_blank"}

## Install Middleware
execute below composer command to install ```tymon/jwt-auth``` middleware for jwt authentication system.

```bash
# vagrant ssh
# sudo docker exec -it laradock_workspace_1 bash
composer require tymon/jwt-auth
```

## Configure Provider
open ```config/app.php``` file in Laravel project folder and add Provider like below.

```php
...
'providers' => [
    ...
    Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider::class,
    ...
]
...
```

after configuration, execute below artisan command to apply the middleware.

```bash
# vagrant ssh
# sudo docker exec -it laradock_workspace_1 bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```

if you get the error like below,

```bash
In ProviderRepository.php line 208:
Class 'Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider' not found
```

you should update ```tymon/jwt-auth``` version. modify ```composer.json``` file like below.

```json
...
"require": {
    ...
    "tymon/jwt-auth": "^1.0.0-rc.3"
    ...
},
...
```

after modifying the version, execute below composer command to update it.

```bash
composer update
```

and execute artisan command again to apply the middleware.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
```

## Create Secret Key
we need to create secret key which ```tymon/jwt-auth``` middleware uses.

```bash
php artisan jwt:secret
```

check below exists at the bottom of ```.env``` file

```
JWT_SECRET=*******
```

## Completed
we saw how to install and configure ```tymon/jwt-auth``` middleware for jwt(Json Web Token) based authentication system. next blog, we'll introduce how to use jwt to develop authentication system.
